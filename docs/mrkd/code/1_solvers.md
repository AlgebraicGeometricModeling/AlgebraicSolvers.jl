# Solvers

Several types of solvers are available in the packages. 
They differ in the way the truncated normal form is computed.


## Solvers using resultant constructions

```@docs 
AlgebraicSolvers.solve_macaulay
AlgebraicSolvers.solve_toric
```

## Solvers using Groebner basis computation

```@docs 
AlgebraicSolvers.solve_groebner
```


# Truncated  Normal Forms

```@docs 
AlgebraicSolvers.tnf_macaulay
AlgebraicSolvers.tnf_toric
```

# Linear algebra in the quotient 

```@docs 
AlgebraicSolvers.matrix_mult
AlgebraicSolvers.quotient_basis
```
